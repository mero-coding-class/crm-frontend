# Pagination Debugging and Fixes

## Completed Tasks
- [x] Added console logs in Leads.jsx to track totalPages setting from backend count or list length
- [x] Added useEffect in Leads.jsx to log currentPage and totalPages changes
- [x] Added console logs in LeadTableDisplay.jsx handlePageChange to track button clicks and delegation

## Next Steps
- [ ] Test pagination UI by clicking next/previous buttons and checking console logs
- [ ] Verify that totalPages is correctly calculated from backend response
- [ ] Confirm that onPageChange updates currentPage and triggers new fetch
- [ ] Ensure pagination buttons are enabled/disabled correctly based on currentPage and totalPages
- [ ] If issues persist, check backend response format and pagination parameters
